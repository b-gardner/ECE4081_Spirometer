# ECE4081 Spirometer #
By Bryce Gardner and Ali Qasimi
## Description
This is a project to construct a spirometer for the Monash unit ECE4081: Medical Instrumentation. A spirometer is a device used primarily to measure a patient's lung capacity. Spirometry is used to diagnose asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and other conditions that affect breathing.
## In this project
In this project you'll find we ran on an Arduino Uno. Below is a parts list:
  * Arduino Uno
  * MPX53DP Differential Pressure sensor or equiv. 
  * Adafruit SSD1306 128x64 OLED display
  * 3x OpAmp, we used an MC660CN which is a Quad-opamp in a DIP package
  * assorted resistors for amplifier
